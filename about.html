                    <dd>I scheduled, moderated, and took notes for the meetings.  I reviewed the code for bugs and managed version control merges using git-based software.   I was one of the two main collaborators for the HTML code.  I also worked on a little of the CSS specifically on the media queries.  I also was part of the debugging process.</dd>

                    <dt>Samantha Holly</dt>
                    <dd>I was the other of the two main collaborators that worked with the HTML code. I researched all of the content for the Ghanaian cuisine and maintained a references page to add to the completed site. I gathered all the photos needed for the site, edited/resized them to fit with the web pages and created the image slideshow on the index page. Lastly, I was final editor of all pages, ensuring page validation, that there were no spelling/grammar errors, and that the project met all of the requirements. </dd>

                    <dd>I am currently a student at Bismarck State College pursuing an associateâ€™s degree in Web Development and Design. For Two Plates<sup>&copy;</sup> I wrote most of the CSS with some help from Edward and was in charge of the overall design esthetic. I also helped debug and edited some html code to better fit the CSS changes made. </dd>
