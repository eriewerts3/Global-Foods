                    <h2>NORWAY</h2>
                    <h3>About Norway</h3>
                    <p>Norwegian food mirrors the history&comma; geography&comma; and culture of Norway.  Many people often think of fish dishes when they think of Norweigian cuisine, especially since fish has been the main export for Norway up until they recently found oil off of their western coast.  However&comma; Norway&apos;s fancier dishes for restaurants&comma; party guests&comma; and holidays are mostly made with red meat instead of fish.  This is because fish is so common, they don&apos;t think of it as desirable or anything special.  While that doesn&apos;t stop them from making great healthy fish dishes for their family&comma; their lamb&comma; meatballs&comma; and reindeer are really where Norwegians pull out their culinary skills. As far as sides go&comma; they use what grows easiest for them in their cold climate.  Cabbage and potatoes are very common side vegetables.  Strawberries&comma; lingonberries&comma; cloudberries&comma; and other berries are very tasty when grown in Norway because of the long summer days there.</p>
