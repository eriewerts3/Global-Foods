                    <h2>Ghana</h2>
                    <h3>About Ghana</h2>
                    <p>The majority of Ghanaian meals are prepared using local ingredients and preparation techniques that have been passed down through many generations. While the Ghanaian cuisine may be rather simple, where it lacks in creativity, it makes up for
                    with robust flavors created by various traditional spices and sauces. Food is considered a celebration in Ghana; parties, festivals and any other celebrations are often centered around food and sharing meals. Because so many of these meals
                    are passed down through generations, food is a way to bring everyone together to show off and celebrate their Ghanaian roots. Dishes are often centered around some sort of local wild animal; i.e. chicken or goat, and paired with rice or yams
                    and a traditional Ghanainan sauce, often times Shito or Pepe.

                            <li>Let it rest for about 10 to 20 minutes to absorb the flavor.</li>
                            <li>Heat up a large skillet or cast iron with oil up to 1/2 inch - medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
                            <li>Fry the plantain cubes in batches, turning once, until golden brown - about 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried plantains to pan lined with paper towels.</li>
                            <li>Serve warm.</li>

                        <b>Ingredients</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.5 cup un-ripened plantain</li>
                            <li>1 lb cassava</li>
                            <li>480ml of water for blending</li>
                            <li>80ml of water for steaming</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Directions</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Peel the plantain and cut into cubes. Peel and scrape the cassava, de-string it, and cut into cubes.</li>
                            <li>Place the cassava and plantain into a blender. Add 350ml if you want a more firm fufu, and 450ml for a softer fufu.</li>
                            <li>Process into a smooth paste.</li>
                            <li>Heat the paste in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spatula for 8-10 min to remove lumps.</li>
                            <li>Add remaining 50ml of water to the mixture. Reduce heat to lowest setting, cover with lid and steam for another 8-10 min.</li>
                            <li>Increase heat to medium and stir. The fufu might look too soft, but it will become firmer as it cools.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the fufu into a bowl and sprinkle 1 tbsp of water on the surface to prevent a film from forming. Let cool completely.</li>
                            <li>Shape fufu into a ball and serve with soup.</li>
